		<p> Hi, my name is Caitlin Reid. I graduated from Rutgesr University in 2015 with a degree in  Philosophy, but over the last year I've been developing websites with the code-less web application, Wix.com. This is my very first hand-coded website! </p>
		<p>I decided to give coding a try because I've been a life-long craftsperson; the painstaking attention required to get something to look <em>just right</em> doesn't frighten me. Comparisons between coding and knitting or carpentry intrigued me- I enjoy coming up with a new idea and pursuing the trial-and-error process needed to make it a reality. </p>
		<p> Here is a sample of some of the web and design projects I've worked on in the last year. If you're interested in one of my projects, eager to collaborate, or looking to connect with someone (new!) to New York City, please feel free to reach out. </p>
